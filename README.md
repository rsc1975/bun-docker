# Docker image for bun

Based on [alpine linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) and [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu), the building process is fired when a new [version of bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases) is detected and a scheduled daily image based on bun `canary` version

* On new bun version, tags created: `latest` and `x.y.z` based on alpine & `ubuntu` and `x.y.z-ubuntu` based on ubuntu:22.04
* Scheduled every 12h on bun canary version, tag created: `canary` (based on alpine)

The image [dvlprtech/bun](https://hub.docker.com/r/dvlprtech/bun) is published  in DockerHub 



## Getting started

```sh
docker run -it --rm dvlprtech/bun --version
```
It will output for instance:
```txt
0.1.9
```

To launch a local file we need to map the file dir to the container:

```sh
echo 'console.log(`Hello ${process.argv[process.argv.length - 1] || "World"} !!`);' > hi.js
docker run -it --rm -v$(pwd):/app dvlprtech/bun run /app/hi.js Folks
```
It will show:
```
Hello Folks !!
```

Yo can also use the image as base for your bun own project:

```dockerfile
#Dockerfile
FROM dvlprtech/bun:latest
...
```
